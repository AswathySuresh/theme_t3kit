# WIP/Test branch

## !! Development branch - not for production!!

This branch is made to make it possible to check what changes that needs to be done in theme_t3kit extension. Most of the extensions included in theme_t3kit release aren't included in this branch for now and most of them will most likley be moved to suggest. Also note that there are still much more to fix for TYPO3 version 9.

Since Themes extension isn't included now, there where need for some changes in templates and ts to be able to render frontend.
